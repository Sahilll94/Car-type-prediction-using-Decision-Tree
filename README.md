# Car Type Prediction

This project aims to predict the type of cars using supervised learning techniques. It utilizes parameters like car horsepower and number of seats to classify cars into categories such as Super-car, SUV, Sedan, etc.

## Overview

In this project, we built a machine learning model to predict the type of cars based on their features. We used a decision tree classifier to train the model and achieve accurate predictions and I created a dataset by my own for learning it from basics.

## Dataset

I created our own dataset for this project, containing information about various cars including their horsepower, number of seats, and corresponding types. The dataset was then used for training and testing our model.

## Code

The code for this project can be found in the `car_type_prediction.ipynb` notebook file. I used Python programming language along with libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for data manipulation, model training, and visualization.

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `day-3-of-ml-bootcamp-supervised-learning.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible environment.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to train the model and make predictions.
